# Fractals-displayed-with-OpenCV

Illustrates a quick method to display image data produced using one's C++ library of choice with OpenCV.   

The complexity of GUI and graphic engine API's that interact directly with standard C++ is among the deterrents that often push programmers to other prototyping languages and solutions. The image rendering device adopted by OpenCV implements a transparent class friendly with whatever array type data the programmer likes to input. This piece of coding is a humble example that could have been entirely written using OpenCV's API but its purpose is to show that one can readily control pixels in C++ without learning OpenCV whose utility is way vaster than displaying graphics. The advantage: C++ native and concurrent programming freedom. The cost: the installation of the OpenCV C++ library.
