# Fractals-displayed-with-OpenCV
Illustrates a quick method to display image data produced using one's C++ library of choice with OpenCV.   
The complexity of GUIs and graphic engines API's that interact directly with standard C++ is among the deterrents that often push programmers to other prototyping languages and solutions. The image rendering device adopted by OpenCV implements a transparent class friendly with whatever matrix data the programmer likes to input. This piece of coding is a humble example. The advantage: C++ native and concurrent programming freedom. The cost: the installation of the OpenCV C++ library.
